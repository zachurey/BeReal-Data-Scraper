# BeReal-Data-Scraper

This is a fun python project that acts as a wrapper for the BeReal API.

In order to properly use this project, first you must obtain a "refresh token" for
an active BeReal account. Then, assign this to a variable ```refresh-token``` in a ```.env``` file
in the main directory.
